            <div class="description">The American Vintage '50s Diner Double Beef burger is, if my weak Japanese skills can be trusted, their image of a 1950s diner steak plate, but in hamburger form:
                 double 100 percent beef patties with a fried egg, a slice of cheese, onions, Chicago-style steak sauce, and a mashed potato sauce on a classic whole wheat bun.</div>

            <div class="description">Press down on the bun. Like slurping a crawfish head or licking a yogurt lid, puncturing the yolk via bun compression is tactilely satisfying. When you do, 
                watch it ooze, egg yolk lewdly spilling over the sides of the sandwich.The yellow against the char of the patty makes for an appealing visual contrast. The controlled spill feels very art school. </div>
