        <div class="description">Delicious milo milkshake which taste so yummy and very refreshing. This is a great way to make kids drink milk. It is a drink that 
            is traditionally made by blending cow's milk, ice cream, and flavorings or sweeteners such as butterscotch, caramel sauce, chocolate syrup, fruit syrup, or whole fruit into a thick, sweet, cold mixture.</div>

        <div class="description">This recipe is super kid-friendly, easy to make, and delicious. A favorite for kids' 'How To' speeches or just to enjoy
             on a hot day. This sweet treat is a chocolate lover's dream! Best eaten with a spoon and straw. If you prefer a thicker consistency, add more ice cream and less milk. Enjoy! </div>

        <div class="description">Shakes are a summertime staple around here but with sweet, spring strawberries hitting the stores we think itâ€™s high time to take an early plunge

        <div class="description">It is an ideal drink for growing up kids or for people looking for energy drinks. This dry fruits milkshake is very filling and you might like to skip a meal after having it. 
            I have used soy milk instead of regular milk to make it. You can use regular milk or also make with almond milk.</div>
