            <pre class="dish">Diner Double                         $12.99</pre>
            <div class="description">The American Vintage '50s Diner Double Beef burger is, if my weak Japanese skills can be trusted, their image of a 1950s diner steak plate, but in hamburger form:
                 double 100 percent beef patties with a fried egg, a slice of cheese, onions, Chicago-style steak sauce, and a mashed potato sauce on a classic whole wheat bun.</div>

            <div class="description">Delicious milo milkshake which taste so yummy and very refreshing. This is a great way to make kids drink milk. It is a drink that 
                is traditionally made by blending cow's milk, ice cream, and flavorings or sweeteners such as butterscotch, caramel sauce, chocolate syrup, fruit syrup, or whole fruit into a thick, sweet, cold mixture.</div>

            <div class="description">Butter and especially stronger oils, such as walnut, can also add flavor to bread. Dry milk powder adds flavor to bread and can soften its texture, as in the 
                case of this basic white sourdough.Nuts make a lovely addition to breads, but because they are prone to rancidity, always taste them before adding them to dough.</div>

            <pre class="dish">Egg Attack                           $15.99</pre>
            <div class="description">Press down on the bun. Like slurping a crawfish head or licking a yogurt lid, puncturing the yolk via bun compression is tactilely satisfying. When you do, 
                watch it ooze, egg yolk lewdly spilling over the sides of the sandwich.The yellow against the char of the patty makes for an appealing visual contrast. The controlled spill feels very art school. </div>

            <div class="description">Upma is a traditional Indian breakfast made with sooji (also called rava in south). It’s more common in South India but now I see it just as much everywhere in India.
                Rava Upma is often served with coconut chutney and filter coffee. I mostly eat it as much but of course the addition of chutney (& filter coffee!) makes it even more appetizing.  </div>
